### Abstract
Most modern package manager standards, including payment providers and native depictions, were introduced in 2018 by Sileo with the goal of making purchase handling easier for repositories offering commercial packages. However, other packaging solutions exist, complicating implementation by repositories. This outlined document introduces a standard that can be implemented by anyone.

### Structure
This specification is split up into three sections: [*Active*](Active/), [*Deprecated*](Deprecated/), and [*Discontinued*](Discontinued/). These folders contain specification features that are currently in use, deprecated and being removed on their specified date, and features that no longer exist.

### Contributing
Due to the open nature of this specification, the Repository Standards Consortium accepts changes to the specification. To get started please check out the [Template How-To](CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit changes via Pull Request.
